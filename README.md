# ProjectONYX
Distributed Test Driven Software Development built on the Ethereum blockchain

# End Vision

The end vision of Project ONYX is a platform that allows software companies to become many times more efficient by focusing on high level design and architecture and leaving implementation to ONYX. Just as Stack Overflow has sparked the open sharing of knowledge between different sectors and companies of the industry, ONYX will enable the sharing of work between everyone in the industry. Taken to its limit, ONYX could change the entire software industry by leading to smaller companies that do the work of the giant behemoth companies of today. In addition to this, ONYX could change what it means to be a software developer by making it so that one can submit work to any companies on ONYX and work entirely at his/her own pace, schedule, and location.

# Benefits of the blockchain

1. No middle man so that privacy concerns are mitigated.
2. Trust is guaranteed by code not people.
3. No single point of failure and no downtime.
4. Community controlled platform where prices, fees, and requirements are all decided by the users so that the platform is always listening to its users.
5. Maintainence and running costs are negligible since all code is deployed onto the blockchain not private servers.
